# Cyclistic-Capstone

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone project. The goal of the project was to view 12 months of data from the fictitious bike company "Cyclistic" and discover the different ways members and casual riders use the bikes provided. The final part of the project was aimed at offering recommendations to the company on how to convert more casual riders into members.
